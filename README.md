# Deep Dive Into WP-CLI

This repo was created for my talk at [WordCamp Lagos 2019](http://2019.lagos.wordcamp.org).

The pdf file is the lecture notes.

The installwp.sh file is the script for installing a bare WordPress site with WP-CLI

The demo.sh file is the script for installing a WordPress site and doing some things, it is properly commented and easy to understand.

The scripts.txt file contains sample scripts and what they do.

[Tweet at me](http://twitter.com/geektutor) if you have questions.

Thank you
